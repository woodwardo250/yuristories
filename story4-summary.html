        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In a parallel world, a failed music producer wakes up to find himself living the life he always dreamed of-successful, wealthy, and 15 years younger. His fame was built on a single song that skyrocketed after a singer's cover, launching him into stardom. But his new life takes a dark turn when the truth about his father, a mass murderer responsible for a train crash that killed hundreds, is exposed. Shunned by the music industry and society, he faces relentless harassment and danger. As he plans his future with a secret AI project, a chance encounter with a former collaborator offers him unexpected help. Yet, paranoia and fear grow as he realizes no one, not even himself, can be trusted in this unforgiving reality.</p>
