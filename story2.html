    <h1>Whispers in the Rain</h1>
    <p>[Ah Ching and Ah Wen had been inseparable since childhood, their bond as natural and deep as the roots of a centuries-old tree. 
From the first day of school to endless summer vacations, they were side by side, weaving their lives together in a way that felt predestined. For others, they were the "perfect duo," but for Ah Ching, her feelings for Ah Wen had long since transcended friendship. What began as innocent affection grew into a burning love she kept locked away in the most secret chambers of her heart. She couldn't risk shattering the delicate world they shared by exposing her deepest emotions.Every glance at Ah Wen's radiant face sent Ah Ching's heart racing. Each laugh, every shared moment between them, made her feel as though the world had shrunk to just the two of them. While Ah Wen adored beauty in all its forms, Ah Ching adored only her. She lived in the shadows of her own love, imprisoned by the fear of rejection, but even more by the dread that she might lose Ah Wen altogether if her feelings were revealed.In their university years, Ah Ching found herself sharing Ah Wen with another—a bright, charismatic boy named Ah Lok. Ah Wen had introduced him casually one day, her eyes glowing as she spoke about how funny and easygoing Ah Lok was. At first, Ah Ching felt no threat. She told herself their friendship could weather any storm. But with time, Ah Lok's presence began to unravel the delicate fabric of Ah Ching's carefully guarded world. The chemistry between Ah Wen and Ah Lok was undeniable. They laughed too easily, exchanged glances too often. What Ah Ching had once dismissed as a harmless connection soon became something far more dangerous—Ah Lok was falling for Ah Wen, and worst of all, Ah Wen seemed to be falling for him too.
Ah Ching's world tilted one afternoon when Ah Lok pulled her aside, his face flushed with excitement. "I'm going to confess to Ah Wen," he said, his voice trembling with anticipation. "I need your help to make it special. You know her better than anyone." His words pierced Ah Ching's heart like a blade. She stood frozen, her mind spiraling into chaos. Help him? Help him take the person she loved most?But how could she refuse without seeming selfish? How could she betray the friend she had always been to Ah Wen? So, with a smile that didn't reach her eyes, Ah Ching agreed. Her hands trembled as she helped Ah Lok prepare the romantic setting for his confession. She chose the perfect café—the one Ah Wen loved, with soft lighting and the scent of fresh flowers in the air. It should have been their moment, but instead, Ah Ching found herself relegated to the role of a mere observer.The scene unfolded like a nightmare. From the shadows, Ah Ching watched as Ah Lok stood before Ah Wen, confessing his love. 
She saw Ah Wen's face light up with joy, her smile wide and bright in the soft glow of the café. Then, in an agonizing moment, Ah Wen accepted his feelings. They embraced, and when their lips met in a kiss, something inside Ah Ching shattered. Her heart broke into a million pieces, each one a sharp reminder of what she could never have.From that day forward, Ah Ching became the invisible third wheel in their relationship, not an obstacle but a witness. She stood by, watching the love between Ah Wen and Ah Lok blossom, all while burying her own unspoken feelings deeper and deeper. She attended their gatherings, smiled through their shared moments of affection, and pretended that her heart wasn't being torn apart. The worst was Ah Wen's birthday. Ah Lok had planned an elaborate surprise, filling their favorite park with lights and flowers. It was everything Ah Ching had dreamed of doing for Ah Wen but never dared. As she watched Ah Wen's face light up, her heart ached with a painful awareness that she could never give her that joy. 
That night, after the celebration, Ah Ching excused herself and slipped into a quiet corner of the park. Beneath the stars, where no one could see, she cried silently, her tears falling like the petals of the flowers Ah Lok had so carefully chosen. She knew she had lost Ah Wen completely, if she had ever had her at all.Their friendship remained, but it was hollow now, a pale shadow of what it had once been. Ah Wen seemed to sense the unspoken secret that lay between them, but chose to ignore it. When they were alone together, an uncomfortable silence often settled between them, as if both were tiptoeing around something they dared not name. Ah Ching tried to let go, to move on, but every time she saw Ah Wen with Ah Lok, every time she watched them laugh or share a kiss, her heart twisted painfully. She couldn't leave, but she couldn't stay either. It was a slow, excruciating kind of torture.As Ah Wen and Ah Lok's relationship grew stronger, they began planning to live together, and the final nail was driven into the coffin of Ah Ching's unrequited love. She knew she couldn't continue like this, playing the role of the supportive friend while her heart bled. She needed to leave, to escape before the pain consumed her entirely. When Ah Wen and Ah Lok finally married, Ah Ching was there, standing in the crowd like a ghost. The ceremony was beautiful—Ah Wen in her wedding dress, looking radiant, exchanging vows with the man she loved. Ah Ching smiled through the entire ceremony, but it was a brittle, fragile thing. As they kissed and the guests applauded, she slipped away quietly, leaving before anyone could notice her absence. It was the last time she allowed herself to be a part of their world.Ah Ching moved to another city, changed her job, made new friends, and built a life far away from the people who had once meant everything to her. Time passed. 
Fifteen years went by, and on the surface, she seemed to have moved on. Her career flourished, and she surrounded herself with friends, but none of them ever touched the deepest parts of her heart. No one ever replaced Ah Wen. And then, one rainy afternoon, fate intervened. 
Ah Ching stepped into a café to escape the downpour, the familiar scent of coffee wrapping around her like a memory. As she glanced around the room, her gaze froze. There, sitting in the corner, was Ah Wen. Her hair, once jet-black, was now streaked with gray, and there was a weariness about her that hadn't been there before. But despite the years that had passed, she was still Ah Wen. Still the woman Ah Ching had loved for so long.Ah Ching's heart raced, just as it had all those years ago. Her first instinct was to turn and leave, to run before those buried feelings could resurface. But something in her refused to let go. She took a deep breath and, before she could lose her nerve, approached the table. 
"Ah Wen?"Ah Wen looked up, her eyes widening in surprise before a warm smile spread across her face. "Ah Ching? Is it really you?" Her voice was soft, carrying a weight that Ah Ching hadn't expected.They sat down, awkward at first, but slowly, they fell back into the rhythm of their old friendship. They spoke about their lives, about the years that had passed. Ah Wen mentioned living alone now, her tone tinged with a sadness that Ah Ching couldn't ignore."Where's Ah Lok?" Ah Ching asked cautiously, her stomach knotting at the thought of hearing his name after so long.Ah Wen's smile faltered, and she lowered her gaze. "We divorced two years ago."The words hit Ah Ching with a strange mixture of shock and guilt. Ah Wen's marriage had ended, and beneath her sympathy lay something darker—a flicker of hope, one that she quickly smothered. As they continued talking, Ah Ching couldn't help but notice the vulnerability in Ah Wen, the loneliness that seemed to hover around her. They began meeting more frequently after that day, their old friendship slowly rekindling. But this time, the dynamic was different. With each meeting, Ah Ching felt her long-buried love for Ah Wen resurfacing with a vengeance. It was stronger, more insistent, than it had ever been.]</p>
