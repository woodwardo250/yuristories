    <h1>Story 4</h1>
    <p>
It all escalated one night. I was walking down a quiet street when a man jumped from the shadows, a knife in hand. "You killed my wife and child!" he screamed. The knife sliced into my arm before I could react, pain flaring white-hot. I stumbled back, blood soaking my sleeve, when a gunshot rang out, startling both of us.

"Step back or the next shot goes through your head!" A woman’s voice, sharp and commanding. The man bolted, and I collapsed, clutching my arm. I looked up at my savior, confused. She was familiar—too familiar.

She removed her mask, revealing a face I recognized from my past—or rather, this parallel life’s past. She was a singer, part of a band I had once composed for. "You’re safe now," she said, offering her hand.

I let her help me up, still reeling. "Why are you helping me?" I asked.

Her answer was simple, almost dismissive. "Because no one else will."

We walked together to my house, but as we approached, I noticed something was wrong. The door was ajar, lights on inside. I checked the security cameras on my phone—intruders.

We called the police. They came, arrested the men inside, but by then, the realization had hit me: I wasn’t safe, not even in my own home.

She stayed with me that night. I was still baffled by her kindness, unsure if it was out of pity or something else entirely. But when she offered me a place to stay at her apartment, I accepted. Maybe it was better not to be alone tonight.
