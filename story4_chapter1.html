    <h1>Story 1</h1>
    <p>
    I woke up one day in a life that wasn't mine, yet somehow was.

Gone was the cramped, soulless apartment I had spent the last decade grinding in, composing music for nobody, working office jobs to support a dream that never came true. Instead, I stood in the middle of a high-end penthouse, surrounded by framed platinum records, scattered memorabilia from famous artists, and awards with *my* name engraved on them. 

It felt unreal. It *was* unreal. 

Everything was different, but I was still me—same name, same childhood, same unremarkable early life, but with one glaring difference: I was *successful*. In this parallel world, I wasn’t just a musician scraping by; I was a sought-after composer, a titan in the music industry. After digging into the history of this alternate version of myself, I found the turning point: a single song. A track I had poured my heart into years ago, in my original life, just before I had decided to give up composing professionally. It had failed miserably—flopped, forgotten. Here, though, something had changed. A famous singer had covered it, and it exploded. *Hundreds of videos, thousands of streams*. It became a phenomenon.

That success led to more—record labels knocking on my door, collaborations with major artists, film scores, awards. It was everything I had dreamed of. And the kicker? I was 15 years younger here, 30 instead of 45. A second shot at life, only this time I had the success I had always craved. And I wasn’t about to waste it.

I immediately began setting up my future. Investments in stocks I knew would soar. Quietly laying the groundwork for the AI that had destroyed my career in my original life—a machine learning model so powerful it could predict every action, every trend with almost terrifying accuracy. This time, I’d be the one in control.

Six months into this life, I was thriving. I had composed chart-topping songs, worked with legendary bands, and attended gala events. But paradise, I quickly learned, is always fleeting.

It started with a quiet meeting in an upscale studio. The head of a major record label, someone I’d been working closely with on a nearly-finished track, casually said, "We're pulling the song." 

"Why?" I asked, confused. We were at the final stage—everything was ready to go.

He slid his phone across the table, showing me the screen. The words hit me like a train: *Your father is the murderer of the 724 event*. 

I felt the blood drain from my face. 

My father...a man I had tried to forget. Yes, in this life—just like in my original one—he had caused the infamous 724 train crash, killing over 500 people, including 15 children. He had been the driver and deliberately announced his intent to crash moments before impact. We never knew why. My brother and I were just kids when it happened. We had been protected by anonymity because we were minors. But somehow, here, now, the truth had surfaced.

"I'm sorry," the label head said, his voice flat. I knew he wasn’t sorry at all.

The news spread fast, faster than I could comprehend. Overnight, my name became a symbol of revulsion in the industry. Doors slammed shut, contracts disappeared, calls went unanswered. Even friends avoided me. No one wanted to be associated with the son of a mass murderer. 

But I still had my AI project, my hidden ace. I would let the music industry burn me again—I didn’t care. I could finish the AI model faster than anyone could imagine and secure my future, with or without the recognition I once had.

A month passed, and I was working quietly on my own when the phone rang. "Congratulations," the voice on the other end said. "Your song has won the yearly award for most popular music. The ceremony’s this Friday. We hope to see you there."

I laughed out loud in disbelief. The very industry that had turned its back on me was now giving me one of its highest honors? Of course, I’d go.

The night of the ceremony, the air was thick with tension. I felt the side glances, the whispers, the judgment. I knew what they were thinking: murderer’s son, a stain on the celebration. But I was there for the award. Let them stare.

When the MC called my name, I walked onto the stage alongside the company’s head. But I wasn’t allowed to accept the award. He shook the presenter’s hand for me while I stood to the side, a silent ghost on the stage.

Then, from somewhere in the crowd, it began: "Murderer! Murderer!" A man stood and threw something at me—then another. The crowd erupted in chaos. I heard jeers, felt the sting of objects pelting me. Security rushed me off stage, but the damage was done. By the time I got home that night, social media had exploded. My face was plastered on every news channel. I wasn’t just a pariah in the music world now—I was a national disgrace.

The harassment came fast and hard. People refused me service in restaurants, taxis wouldn’t stop for me. My mailbox was crammed with death threats. Eggs and tomatoes smeared the front of my house daily. I couldn’t leave without a disguise, my face buried beneath a hat and mask.

It all escalated one night. I was walking down a quiet street when a man jumped from the shadows, a knife in hand. "You killed my wife and child!" he screamed. The knife sliced into my arm before I could react, pain flaring white-hot. I stumbled back, blood soaking my sleeve, when a gunshot rang out, startling both of us.

"Step back or the next shot goes through your head!" A woman’s voice, sharp and commanding. The man bolted, and I collapsed, clutching my arm. I looked up at my savior, confused. She was familiar—too familiar.

She removed her mask, revealing a face I recognized from my past—or rather, this parallel life’s past. She was a singer, part of a band I had once composed for. "You’re safe now," she said, offering her hand.

I let her help me up, still reeling. "Why are you helping me?" I asked.

Her answer was simple, almost dismissive. "Because no one else will."

We walked together to my house, but as we approached, I noticed something was wrong. The door was ajar, lights on inside. I checked the security cameras on my phone—intruders.

We called the police. They came, arrested the men inside, but by then, the realization had hit me: I wasn’t safe, not even in my own home.

She stayed with me that night. I was still baffled by her kindness, unsure if it was out of pity or something else entirely. But when she offered me a place to stay at her apartment, I accepted. Maybe it was better not to be alone tonight.
