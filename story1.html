    <h1>The Blossoming Heart</h1>
    <p>[For fifteen months, I’d worked in this little floral shop, and for every one of those weeks, like clockwork, she had walked in as soon as I flipped the sign to *open* on Monday mornings. She always ordered the same thing: a modest bouquet of white lilies and pink carnations wrapped in simple kraft paper. We never exchanged more than pleasantries, but it was routine, something I almost took comfort in. She was that reliable.

But one Monday, she didn’t come in when I opened. The hours ticked by, and still, no sign of her. As the day stretched into evening and I prepared to close up, I heard the bell above the door jingle. I looked up, and there she was, standing in the doorway, slightly breathless as if she’d been running. 

“Glad I made it,” she said, a bit of relief in her voice.

I smiled at her, glad to see her despite my concern earlier in the day. “You want your usual?” I asked, already turning toward the counter to prepare her bouquet.

“That would be great,” she replied, glancing around. Then, noticing the broom I had propped against the door, she added, “But if you’re closing up, I can come by tomorrow. I don’t want to keep you.”

I waved off her concern, shaking my head. “These flowers won’t last another day. Might as well let you have them now.”

She gave a small, appreciative smile, her dark eyes warm despite the weariness in them. “That’s lucky for the both of us, then.”

It struck me, suddenly, that we had never spoken this much before, despite her being a weekly fixture in my mornings. I moved to gather her usual order, but as I did, the sky outside opened up with a torrential downpour. The rain was pounding hard against the glass windows, thick sheets of it making the world outside look like a blur.

I grabbed the half-wrapped bouquet and pulled it inside, away from the door. “Looks like you’re going to have to wait this one out,” I said, turning to her. 

She hesitated, eyes flicking toward the door, and then back to me. “I don’t want to be a bother.”

I shook my head again, smiling. “Don’t worry about it. I’m stuck here too—can’t walk to my bus stop in this. Might as well stay with me until it clears up.”

She seemed to relax a little, nodding, and then quietly moved to one of the chairs near the window. She sat down, and for the first time in fifteen months, I took a real, long look at her. 

She looked like she was in her late twenties, maybe early thirties. Her dark hair fell loosely over her shoulders, damp at the ends, likely from her sprint to the shop in the rain. There was something effortlessly attractive about her—her features were delicate but striking. A fine jawline, lips that seemed to be perpetually caught between a smile and something more reserved, and her skin, pale with the faintest hint of color on her cheeks. Her eyes, though, those were what I noticed the most. Dark, deep, like they held onto things, secrets maybe, things she didn’t share in the short exchanges we’d had before today.

Her clothes were simple but classy. A fitted, deep green coat that accentuated her slender figure, a black skirt peeking out from underneath, and ankle boots that looked both practical and fashionable. She wasn’t overly done up, but there was an air of refinement about her that drew my attention. And now, with the rain pouring outside, the quiet intimacy of the shop felt oddly heavy.

As I continued packing her bouquet, I asked, “So, what are the flowers for? If you don’t mind me asking.”

She paused, looking at me for a moment before answering, “They’re for my parents.” There was a softness in her voice now, something personal. “They passed away a few years ago, and I… I bring them flowers every Monday. It’s just something I like to do.”

I looked at her, surprised. I hadn’t expected something so personal, especially not now. “I didn’t know,” I said softly. “But I’m glad you like the flowers here.”

She smiled at that, just a small tug at the corner of her lips. “I do. They’re always perfect.”

The rain continued to drum against the windows, louder now as the wind picked up. We fell into a comfortable silence. I busied myself behind the counter while she stayed seated, watching the rain or maybe lost in her own thoughts. There was a strange sense of calm between us, the kind of quiet that didn’t need to be filled with idle conversation.

After what felt like an hour, the storm didn’t seem to be letting up anytime soon. She stood and walked over to the counter, her expression thoughtful. “You know,” she said, “I really appreciate you letting me stay here while it’s raining like this. I’d hate to think I kept you here longer than you wanted to be.”

I chuckled softly, shaking my head. “It’s no problem at all. Besides, I’d rather stay dry, and it’s nice having company for once.”

She seemed to consider something for a moment, then looked up at me, her dark eyes meeting mine. “Let me take you out for a meal. Tonight or sometime soon. To thank you.”

Her offer caught me off guard, but a smile spread across my face before I could help it. This was definitely not what I expected from our usual, wordless interactions.

“I’d love that,” I replied, feeling a mix of surprise and excitement I hadn’t felt in a while.

We exchanged numbers quickly, and she promised to set something up in the next couple of days. As I handed her the bouquet, the rain finally began to slow down to a soft patter.

She lingered for a moment at the door, the bouquet held carefully in her arms, and glanced back at me. “Thank you again.”

“Anytime,” I replied, watching as she stepped out into the rain, her figure disappearing into the misty streets, leaving behind the scent of flowers and the feeling that something, perhaps, was finally starting.

Later that night, as I locked up the shop, I couldn’t help but wonder where this unexpected encounter would lead. Something told me it wasn’t going to be as predictable as the bouquets she ordered every Monday.]</p>
